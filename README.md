# Sorbonne-University

Collection of TP's (travaux pratiques) - or practical exercises - from different mathematics classes in Sorbonne University in Paris.

Thanks to a friend who is student of this university, I have access to all of these materials for my own practice.

These notebooks contain my own code and intepretation of the problems given in the courses. In does not mean in any way the answers to these problems. If you are a Sorbonne University's students, I have you would find these useful, but please do not copy these codes for your own submission.
