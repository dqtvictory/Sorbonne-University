# 3MA100 - Programming with Python for maths

This folder includes very useful topics in maths with their implementation in Python. The original files are in French, but as I'm doing the exercises, I try to translate to English at the same time.

At the moment, the following are finished:

- __Chapter 3: Data structure.__ Done and translated
- __Chapter 5: Graph theory.__ Done and translated
- __Chapter 6: Algebra.__ Done and translated
- __Chapter 7: Solving functions.__ Almost done. Not translated
- __Chapter 8: Probability and Statistics.__ *TODO*
- __Chapter 9: Differential equations.__ *TODO*
- __Chapter 10: Symbolic calculations.__ *TODO*
- __Chapter 11: Cryptography.__ *TODO*
- __*Bonus*__: Sujet blanc, revision for the final exam. *TODO*
