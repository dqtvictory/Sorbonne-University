    "A graph is a pair $G = (X, E)$ made of a non-empty and finite set $X$, and another set $E$ of pairs of elements in $X$. The elements in $X$ represent the vertices of the graph $G$, and those in $E$ are edges of $G$.\n",
    "A graph is oriented when there are directions, meaning the pairs of elements in $E$ are ordered lists, meaning $(i,j) \\in E$ is not equivalent to $(j,i)\\in E$. The scope of this lesson considers only non-oriented graphs, meaning the order of any pair of elements of $X$ are not taken into account ($\\{i,j\\} \\in E$).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a complete graph of $n$ vertices $K_n$ is a graph with $X = {1,2,\\dots,n}$ having as edges all possible combinations of pair of elements in $X$. In particular, $K_4 = (X,E)$ where $X=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $E = \\big\\{ \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{3, 4\\}  \\big\\}$.\n",
